# Concepts to understand first #

The plugin is designed to process 2 types of SLA.

1. **Customer response SLAs**
Customer response SLAs define how quickly a help desk should respond to a customer based upon the priority of the issue.

2. **Resolution SLAs**
Resolution SLAs define how quickly an issue will be resolved within based upon the priority of the issue.

### Example scenario ###

You are running a help desk supporting multiple clients. Clients can raise issues with various priorities, for example:

**Priority 1 - Not Usable** Priority 2 - Severe Limitation
**Priority 3 - Slight Limitation**

**Client X**

You have the following agreements (SLAs) with client X to respond to issues with particular priorities within a given time frame:

| **Priority** | **Agreed response time** |
|:-------------|:-------------------------|
| Priority 1   | Within 10 minutes during office hours (9am-5:30pm) |
| Priority 2   | Within 30 minutes during office hours (9am-5:30pm) |
| Priority 3   | Within 8 hours during office hours (9am-5:30pm) |

You have the following agreements (SLAs) with client X to resolve the issue for particular priorities within a given time frame:

| **Priority** | **Agreed resolution time** |
|:-------------|:---------------------------|
| Priority 1   | Within 4 hours minutes during office hours (9am-5:30pm) |
| Priority 2   | Within 16 hours during office hours (9am-5:30pm) |
| Priority 3   | Within 30 hours during office hours (9am-5:30pm) |
